/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for Cupping Compass.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model, ensuring that users can only
 * access their own data.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * All data is nested under /users/{userId}, providing a clear ownership hierarchy.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User listing is disallowed to prevent unauthorized enumeration of users.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 *  - The `id` field of a User document is validated against the `userId` path
 *    parameter to prevent unauthorized data access.

     * @deny (get, update, delete) - A user cannot access another user's profile data.
