/**
 * @file Firestore Security Rules for Cupping Compass.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model. Each user can only
 * read and write their own profile data and their own evaluations.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores public user profile information.
 * - /users/{userId}/evaluations/{evaluationId}: Stores individual coffee evaluations made by a specific user.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Users can only manage their own data; there are no admin roles.
 * - Listing of all users is disallowed.
 * - Evaluations are private to the user who created them.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * The 'Evaluation' documents contain the 'userId' field, which is used to
 * enforce ownership without requiring additional reads. This ensures that
 * evaluations can only be accessed by their creator.
