/**
 * @file Firestore Security Rules
 * @core_philosophy This ruleset enforces a user-ownership model for user profiles
 * and restricts access to invitations based on roles and authentication.
 * It is written in Prototyping Mode, so write rules are highly restrictive but flexible on data shapes.
 * @data_structure
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores user profile data.
 * - /invitations/{invitationId}: Stores invitation data for cupping sessions.
 * @key_security_decisions
 * - Users can only read and write their own profile data.
 * - Only authenticated users can create invitations.
 * - Invitations can only be read by the invited user or the inviting admin.
 * - Schema validation is relaxed to allow rapid prototyping. Only authorization-critical
 *   fields are validated for integrity.
 * @denormalization_for_authorization
 *   Invitation documents contain the `invitedEmail` field to allow invitees to view
 *   and accept/reject the invitation without querying the users collection. This prevents
 *   the need for costly `get()` operations in the security rules.
 * @structural_segregation User profile data is stored in the /users/{userId} collection, which is separated from
 * the invitation data stored in the /invitations/{invitationId} collection. This allows for better
 * access control and scalability.
