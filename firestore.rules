/**
 * @fileOverview Firestore Security Rules for Cupping Compass.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model, where each user can only access their own data.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * All data is nested under /users/{userId}, ensuring clear ownership and access control.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Users can only access their own profile data.
 * - Users can create their profile (self-registration).
 * - Listing of users is not allowed.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 *  - The `userId` is derived from the path `/users/{userId}`.
 *
 * Structural Segregation:
 *  - Uses separate collections for user data.

     * @allow (get, update, delete) - A user can get, update, or delete their own profile if `request.auth.uid == userId` and the document exists.
     * @deny (create) - A user cannot create a profile with a different `userId`.
     * @deny (get, update, delete) - A user cannot get, update, or delete another user's profile.
     * @principle Enforces document ownership for all operations.
