    "reasoning": "This Firestore data structure focuses on storing user data. Since the authentication providers are password and anonymous, the primary concern is managing user profiles. We leverage path-based ownership for user data, which provides a simple and secure way to manage access control. This approach directly corresponds to the application's need to associate uploaded SCA data, reports, and sessions with specific users.\n\n**Authorization Independence:** The structure inherently provides Authorization Independence, as user-specific data is located under the `/users/{userId}` path, which uses `request.auth.uid` to establish access control. There is no reliance on `get()` calls to parent documents for authorization.\n\n**QAPs:**  This structure directly supports secure `list` operations for user data. Rules can easily filter based on `request.auth.uid == userId` to allow a user to list only their own data. Because the application does not contain roles or shared objects, there are no additional security contexts required."
